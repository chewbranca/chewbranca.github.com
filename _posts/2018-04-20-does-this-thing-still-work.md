Is the mic on? Does this thing still work? It sure has been a while
since I've updated this site. Truth be told, I don't really care for
the current technology I'm using to power this site. I've got a
handful of grand ambitions on what I want a personal "homepage" to be,
but they all require a considerable chunk of development time, which I
haven't invested in yet. As a result, I typically don't bother
updating this site, but the net result of that is that it stays
stagnant and I don't create new content. Well, I've decided to take a
different approach and just start generating the content and be
accepting that this isn't quite what I want it to be, but I can always
fix it later. I mean hey, 301 redirects are a thing, I can migrate
this content to a new site later. So here goes my attempt at
resurrecting chewbranca.com in 2018!
