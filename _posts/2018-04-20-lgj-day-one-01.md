I'm very excited to be diving into the [2018 Lisp Game
Jam](https://itch.io/jam/lisp-game-jam-2018)! My plan is to make a
Diablo-esque pvp deathmatch game! I stumbled upon the awesome open
source [Flare Game](https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-game) that
is a single player action RPG inspired by Diablo. What really
intrigued me about the game is all of the artwork.

I haven't had great luck finding open source isometric game art,
especially with a variety of characters and animations, so when I
found all of the open source artwork in Flare Game, I started dancing
and getting ideas for this game. The Flare Game repo itself that I
linked to above is actually just the game assets, containing the
artwork, animation definitions, maps, map tiles, sounds, etc, and the
engine is in the [Flare
Engine](https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-engine) repo. This is
perfect for me, because I'm rolling my own engine on top of [Love
2D](http://love2d.org/) using Lua, so I just need the art assets.

I've built a library around the Flare Game assets, called
[LFG](https://github.com/chewbranca/lfg), short for Lua Flare
Game. The idea with this library is to take care of parsing the
various animation definitions and making usable characters out of the
sprite sheets.

What does that actually mean? Well, let's take a look. A sprite sheet
is a series of animation frames combined into a single image that you
then load in your game engine to render. So for instance, I've taken
a sprite sheet from Flare Game like this minotaur sprite sheet:

![Minotaur Sprite Sheet](/img/flare-game/minotaur.png)

and using LFG I've turned it into animations like:

![Minotaur Animation](/img/lfg_minotaur.gif)

and that's based on Flare Game's animation definition for the [Minotaur
Animation](https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-game/blob/master/art_src/animation_defs/characters/minotaur.txt)
which looks like:

```
#image=

render_size=128,128
render_offset=64,96

[stance]
position=0
frames=8
duration=1600ms
type=looped

[run]
position=8
frames=8
duration=533ms
type=looped

[swing]
position=16
frames=8
duration=1066ms
type=play_once
...
```

Those animation definition files give you the information to know what
frames correspond to a particular animation, and then the 8 rows of
the sprite sheet correspond to the 8 cardinal directions. So to make
an animation, you figure out which cardinal direction the player is
facing, select the appropriate row, and then select the appropriate
sprite tiles for the desired animation. Then you divide the animation
duration by the number of frames in the animation, and you play each
frame for that long to animate the character.

The idea of the LFG library is to provide a simple library interface
around these Flare Game assets, so you can do things like `local
minotaur = lfg.get_character("Minotaur")` and have the full set of
animations at your disposal. The LFG library also takes care of player
controls, movement, circling strafing, and it has rudimentary
projectiles and collision detection in place. I'm in the process of
adding networking support to it as well. In general, LFG's goal is to
make it easy to build Love 2D games using the wonderful assets from
Flare Game.

## Lisp Game Jam 2018

So how does this all fit together for the Lisp Game Jam? Well, like I
said, I'm going to build a Diabo-esque pvp deathmatch game using the
Flare Game assets! This is the first video game I've ever made, so
I've been having a blast diving in and researching how to build games
and how game engines work and game networking and all that fun
stuff. It's been a bit tortuous not being able to actually start on
the game itself until today, but it took a chunk of work to get LFG to
where it provides higher level abstractions around the Flare Game
assets so you can just grab the different characters and use them in
your game. A handful of the Flare Game character mobs are currently
supported, for instance:

![Random Mobs](/img/lfg_rand_mobs.gif)


"But I thought you said this is a *Lisp* game jam? Lua ain't a Lisp."
Correct! That's where the awesome [Fennel
Lang](https://github.com/bakpakin/fennel) comes in! Fennel is a
lightweight Lisp that compiles down to Lua code with minimal
overhead. So my plan for the game jam is to make a new Love 2D based
game that is written in Fennel, and uses LFG to provide the characters
and game world! The entire point of this game is for pvp deathmatch,
so getting networking in place quickly is a priority for today. I'm
going to focus on LAN only game play, because low latency internet
based gaming is serious undertaking. Maybe in version 2 :D

My plan is to post updates to this blog as development progresses so
folks can see it come together. Happy hacking!
